| #  | Answer | Reasoning |
|----|--------|-----------|
| 1  | C      | IaC automates provisioning using code, enabling repeatable, consistent, and version-controlled infrastructure deployment. |
| 2  | B      | Snowflake environments are unique and hard to reproduce; IaC eliminates them by enforcing consistency through code. |
| 3  | B      | Manual intervention is exactly what IaC seeks to reduce or eliminate through automation. |
| 4  | False  | Terraform is **declarative**, not imperative; you define the desired state, and Terraform figures out the steps. |
| 5  | C      | Declarative statements express **what** should exist (like EC2 in a region), not **how** to make it happen. |
| 6  | C      | Terraform uses a declarative language to define the desired state of infrastructure. |
| 7  | C      | The typical workflow is: **Write** the code → **Plan** to see changes → **Apply** to execute them. |
| 8  | B      | `terraform init` doesn’t format code — `terraform fmt` does that. |
| 9  | A      | When a new provider is added, `init` is required to download necessary plugins. |
| 10 | C      | `terraform plan` shows what changes would be made without applying them — it’s a dry run. |
| 11 | False  | It only **plans** the changes; it doesn't make any modifications to infrastructure. |
| 12 | C      | After applying, Terraform updates the `terraform.tfstate` file with the current state of resources. |
| 13 | D      | Terraform stores state in a file named `terraform.tfstate` by default. |
| 14 | C      | `terraform destroy` is the official command to delete all managed infrastructure. |
| 15 | True   | Terraform must read the state to know what resources exist before it can destroy them. |
| 16 | D      | `terraform fmt` automatically formats `.tf` files to canonical style. |
| 17 | C      | `terraform validate` checks for syntax errors and config structure validity — not provider access. |
| 18 | False  | `terraform validate` checks **syntax**, not your cloud provider credentials. |
| 19 | B      | `terraform output` shows values defined in `output` blocks, which help surface key information. |
| 20 | C      | `terraform show` displays the state file contents in a human-readable way. |
| 21 | C      | Version control via GitHub enables collaboration, review, and CI/CD automation of infrastructure. |
| 22 | C      | Terraform files have a `.tf` extension. |
| 23 | B      | Reviewing the plan ensures you know exactly what changes will happen before applying. |
| 24 | B      | You must initialize the directory with `terraform init` to install providers and set up the backend. |
| 25 | D      | The state file tracks real infrastructure that Terraform manages to detect drift and apply diffs. |
| 26 | A      | If the state file is missing, Terraform cannot track or manage resources properly and will error out. |
| 27 | C      | `terraform output` is specifically for displaying values from declared output blocks in your config. |
| 28 | D      | All listed package managers (`brew`, `apt`, `yum`) can install Terraform, depending on your OS. |
| 29 | B      | Adding Terraform to `$PATH` allows you to run it from anywhere in your shell. |
| 30 | False  | After installation or modifying `$PATH`, you often need to **restart the shell** or source your profile. |
| 31  | B      | The `.terraform.lock.hcl` file tracks exact provider versions and their checksums for consistency and reproducibility. |
| 32  | C      | The lock file is automatically created or updated when you run `terraform init`. |
| 33  | False  | Terraform generates this file automatically; no need for manual creation. |
| 34  | C      | The lock file ensures Terraform uses the exact same provider versions across runs, avoiding unexpected changes. |
| 35  | C      | `terraform init -upgrade` updates the lock file with newer versions of providers. |
| 36  | True   | It’s best practice to commit the lock file so all team members use the same provider versions. |
| 37  | B      | If missing, Terraform will regenerate it during the next `terraform init`. |
| 38  | C      | It stores cryptographic checksums for each provider binary to ensure integrity. |
| 39  | B      | Checksums validate that provider binaries haven’t been tampered with — a security measure. |
| 40  | False  | The lock file affects provider versions, but **not** the infrastructure plan or resource logic. |
