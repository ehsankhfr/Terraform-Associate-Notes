# ✅ Terraform Provisioners

Provisioners in Terraform are used to **execute scripts or commands** on a local or remote system **after a resource is created or destroyed**. They're useful for bootstrapping configurations that **can't be easily handled with Terraform's declarative language**—such as installing software or modifying system files directly.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Use provisioners as a last resort** – they break Terraform’s declarative model and introduce imperative behavior.
- Provisioners are **not idempotent**—Terraform can't track or rollback what they do.
- If a provisioner fails (e.g., script exits with non-zero), the associated resource is **marked as tainted**, and will be recreated on the next apply.

---

## 🔗 Connection Block

To use a **remote-exec** provisioner, you need to define a `connection` block to specify how Terraform should connect to the remote machine (e.g., via SSH):

```hcl
connection {
  type        = "ssh"
  user        = "ubuntu"
  private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
  host        = self.public_ip
}
```

## 🔧 Types of Provisioners

### 1. 🛰️ Remote Exec Provisioner

Runs **commands or scripts on the remote machine** after it has been provisioned.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y nginx",
      "sudo systemctl start nginx"
    ]
  }
}
```

---

### 2. 🖥️ Local Exec Provisioner

Runs a **command on the machine where Terraform is executed**.

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "local" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo 'Provisioning complete!'"
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Use Case Scenarios

| Use Case                             | Use `remote-exec` | Use `local-exec` |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Install packages on a remote VM      | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No            |
| Trigger local shell script           | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes           |
| Notify external API after apply      | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes           |
| Modify remote system files           | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No            |
| Run post-deploy Ansible from local   | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes           |

## 🚫 When Not to Use Provisioners

Avoid provisioners when:
- You can use **user_data** in EC2 instead.
- You can use **cloud-init** for initialization.
- You can bake AMIs with **Packer**.
- You can define configurations using **configuration management tools** like Chef, Puppet, or Ansible (ideally run separately).

---

## 🔁 Tainted Resources

If a provisioner returns a non-zero exit status:
- Terraform will **mark the resource as tainted**, meaning it will be **destroyed and recreated** in the next apply.

```bash
Error: remote-exec provisioner error
│ Error running command 'bad-command': exit status 127
```

## ✅ Summary

| Provisioner Type | Executes On            | Common Use Cases                        |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `remote-exec`    | Remote machine (e.g., EC2) | Install software, start services     |
| `local-exec`     | Local machine (Terraform host) | Notify APIs, run Ansible, custom scripts |

# 🚀 Advanced: Provisioners (Beyond the Exam)

These aren’t critical for the Terraform Associate exam, but deepen your real-world Terraform skills.

---

## 🧱 Chaining Multiple Provisioners

You can define multiple provisioners in one resource. They run **in the order they appear**:

```hcl
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = ["echo 'Step 1'"]
}

provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = ["echo 'Step 2'"]
}
```

---

## 🔄 Destroy-Time Provisioners

You can run provisioners during **resource destruction** with `when = destroy`:

```hcl
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  when   = destroy
  inline = ["echo 'Cleaning up before destruction'"]
}
```

---

## 🧠 Execution Phase

- Provisioners only run during the **create** and **destroy** lifecycle phases.
- They **do not run during a plan** or during changes that do not recreate the resource.
