## üß± What Are Terraform Workspaces?

A **Terraform workspace** is a named instance of Terraform state. Think of each workspace as a separate ‚Äúcopy‚Äù of your infrastructure, maintained independently in the same configuration directory. Each workspace:
- Has its **own state file**
- Shares the same Terraform configuration files (`*.tf`)
- Allows you to deploy identical infrastructure in **multiple environments** (like `dev`, `test`, `staging`, and `prod`) without copying code

> üí° Workspaces isolate the **state**, not the code.

---

## üìÇ Why Use Workspaces?

Workspaces are commonly used for **environment separation**, such as:
- **Development (`dev`)**: Lower-cost resources, frequent changes
- **Staging (`stage`)**: Mirror production for testing, but isolated
- **Production (`prod`)**: Stable, high-availability resources

By using workspaces:
- You avoid duplicating code across folders or Git branches
- You reduce configuration drift
- You streamline environment management in CI/CD pipelines

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Workspaces Work

When you initialize a Terraform directory, Terraform creates a **default workspace** automatically. You can create and switch between other named workspaces.

### Create a new workspace

```bash
terraform workspace new dev
```

This creates a workspace called `dev` and switches to it.

### List existing workspaces

```bash
terraform workspace list
```

Output example:

```
  default
* dev
  prod
```

The `*` indicates the currently selected workspace.

### Switch to another workspace

```bash
terraform workspace select prod
```

Switches to the `prod` workspace.

### Delete a workspace

```bash
terraform workspace delete dev
```

(Remember: this does **not** destroy the associated infrastructure; it only removes the state reference.)

## üß™ Example: Using Workspaces to Manage Environments

Let‚Äôs say you want to manage two environments: `dev` and `prod`. You can use the **same codebase** to provision separate environments.

### Terraform Code (`main.tf`):

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name"
  type        = string
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-app-${var.environment}-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

### Set environment dynamically:

You can pass the workspace name as the variable:

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  default = terraform.workspace
}
```

> This uses the workspace name (e.g., `dev`, `prod`) to dynamically define the environment variable.

So:
- In `dev`, the bucket will be `my-app-dev-bucket`
- In `prod`, the bucket will be `my-app-prod-bucket`

### Workflow:

```bash
terraform init

terraform workspace new dev
terraform apply  # Deploys dev environment

terraform workspace new prod
terraform apply  # Deploys prod environment
```

Each workspace maintains a **separate state**, so resources in `dev` and `prod` don‚Äôt interfere with each other.

## üîê Workspace State Storage with Remote Backends

When using remote backends (like S3), workspaces are supported with separate state files per workspace.

### Example (S3 backend):

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "envs/${terraform.workspace}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

In this example:
- `terraform.workspace` injects the workspace name into the state file path
- This creates state files like:
  - `envs/dev/terraform.tfstate`
  - `envs/prod/terraform.tfstate`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Workspace Caveats

- Workspaces are **not a substitute** for full-fledged CI/CD environment isolation.
- They **only isolate state**, so any code changes affect all workspaces unless guarded by logic.
- **Secrets and config differences** between environments should be managed via variables or external configuration (e.g., `terraform.tfvars` files, environment variables, or `locals`).

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices with Workspaces

- **Use workspaces for minor variations** in environments where infrastructure is mostly the same.
- For drastically different environments (e.g., prod has multi-region HA, dev doesn‚Äôt), consider using **separate Terraform projects**.
- Combine workspaces with **remote state backends and locking** for safety in teams.
- Be careful with **data sources** that may behave differently in different environments (e.g., `aws_ami`).
- Document your environment and workspace usage patterns clearly for teams.
