### Terraform Commands

| **Command**               | **Purpose**                                                                                                     | **CLI Command**                                   | **Expanded Usage Scenarios**                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Terraform fmt**          | Formats Terraform code for readability, ensuring consistent styling and structure across the codebase.            | `terraform fmt`                                   | - Run before committing code to version control to maintain consistent formatting.<br> - After upgrading Terraform, formatting changes may be required.<br> - Ensures uniformity and readability, especially in teams. |
| **Terraform apply -replace** | Forces the recreation of a resource by destroying and recreating it. Useful for fixing issues or changes that need a fresh resource. | `terraform apply -replace="RESOURCE_ADDRESS"`      | - If a resource is misbehaving or corrupted and needs to be recreated.<br> - For ensuring that provisioners or lifecycle operations are re-triggered.<br> - Simulates recreation of a resource that may not be automatically recreated by attribute changes. |
| **Terraform import**       | Imports existing infrastructure resources into Terraform management using the resource-specific identifier (ID). | `terraform import RESOURCE_ADDRESS ID`             | - Managing pre-existing resources that were not originally created with Terraform.<br> - In cases where creating new resources is restricted or cannot be performed.<br> - When you need to manage infrastructure that was set up manually or by another tool. |
| **Terraform validate**      | Validates the syntax and structure of Terraform configuration files, ensuring that the files are correct and free of errors. | `terraform validate`                              | - Run before `terraform plan` to detect any errors or issues in the configuration files.<br> - Useful after making updates to Terraform configurations to ensure there are no syntax errors.<br> - Helps in catching simple mistakes like missing commas, wrong variable types, etc. |
| **Terraform show**         | Outputs human-readable information about the Terraform state or execution plan, showing details about the resources managed by Terraform. | `terraform show`                                  | - Reviewing the current state to understand which resources are managed by Terraform.<br> - Analyzing the plan output to identify what changes will be made when applying the plan.<br> - Troubleshooting changes between multiple state versions. |
| **Terraform graph**        | Generates a visual representation (graph) of the Terraform resource relationships and dependencies.               | `terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png`          | - Visualize complex resource dependencies.<br> - Identifying circular dependencies and resolving issues with resource relationships.<br> - Helps in understanding large infrastructure and its components in a graphical format. |
| **Terraform output**       | Retrieves the values of output variables defined in Terraform, allowing them to be accessed for other uses.       | `terraform output [NAME]`                         | - After applying changes, you can retrieve values of outputs defined in your configurations.<br> - Use output values to integrate Terraform-managed infrastructure with other systems or services.<br> - Can be used to pass information to scripts or other processes after deployment. |
| **Terraform refresh**      | Updates the Terraform state to reflect any changes made to the infrastructure manually or outside Terraform’s control, without modifying the infrastructure itself. | `terraform refresh`                               | - Synchronizes the Terraform state file with the actual infrastructure when changes are made outside Terraform (e.g., manually through the cloud console).<br> - Verifying that the state file is up to date before performing any changes or applying updates. |
| **Terraform console**      | Opens an interactive console for evaluating Terraform expressions, functions, and exploring variables.             | `terraform console`                               | - Test expressions and interpolations before using them in the configuration.<br> - Explore variable values and test their output interactively.<br> - Quickly check the result of complex expressions or variables in real-time. |
| **Terraform Configuration Block** | Controls various Terraform settings and behavior, such as provider versions, state file backends, and required Terraform versions. | Configuration block in `main.tf`                  | - Configuring the backend for state file storage (e.g., using an S3 bucket or remote backend).<br> - Specifying the required Terraform and provider versions to ensure compatibility.<br> - Defining metadata or enabling experimental features for testing purposes in modules. |

### Terraform Configuration Block

- **Purpose**: The **Terraform Configuration Block** is a special block used to configure Terraform’s behavior itself. This is different from resource blocks, as it controls Terraform's own settings, rather than the infrastructure being managed.
  
- **Examples of Configuration Block Uses**:
  - **Configuring backends for state file storage**:
    - This block allows you to specify where Terraform should store its state file (for example, in an S3 bucket, a remote database, or another persistent storage location).
    - Example:
      ```hcl
      terraform {
        backend "s3" {
          bucket = "my-terraform-state"
          key    = "state.tfstate"
          region = "us-west-2"
        }
      }
      ```

  - **Specifying required Terraform version**:
    - You can specify which version of Terraform is required to run the configuration.
    - Example:
      ```hcl
      terraform {
        required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
      }
      ```
    - This ensures that the configuration only runs with a version of Terraform that meets the specified version criteria.

  - **Specifying required provider versions**:
    - Similar to specifying the Terraform version, you can specify which version of providers your configuration requires to function correctly.
    - Example:
      ```hcl
      terraform {
        required_providers {
          aws = {
            version = ">= 3.0"
          }
        }
      }
      ```

  - **Enabling experimental features**:
    - In certain situations, you may want to enable experimental features or test new functionality in Terraform.
    - Example:
      ```hcl
      terraform {
        experimental = true
      }
      ```

  - **Passing metadata to providers**:
    - This can be useful when a provider needs extra information to properly initialize or perform certain actions.
    - Example:
      ```hcl
      terraform {
        required_providers {
          aws = {
            source = "hashicorp/aws"
            version = "3.56.0"
          }
        }
      }
      ```

### Additional Notes:
- **Terraform fmt**: This command is essential for maintaining the codebase in large teams where consistent formatting ensures better collaboration and readability.
  
- **Terraform apply -replace**: Useful for cases where you have a corrupted resource that needs to be recreated (e.g., a resource that was manually changed outside of Terraform). By using this, you force Terraform to destroy and recreate the resource.

- **Terraform import**: This command is highly beneficial for managing legacy infrastructure or when resources are initially provisioned manually (or outside of Terraform).

- **Terraform refresh**: This is especially useful if there’s a gap between the real-world infrastructure state and the Terraform state, ensuring both are in sync.
