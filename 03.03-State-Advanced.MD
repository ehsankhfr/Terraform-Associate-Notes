## 🧠 Advanced Tips & Edge Cases: Terraform State and Workspaces

### 🌀 Workspaces Are Not Full Environment Isolation

While workspaces isolate the **state**, they do **not isolate the configuration**. Any changes you make to `.tf` files apply across all workspaces unless you specifically add logic (e.g., with `locals`, `count`, `for_each`, or conditionals).

> Example: If you delete a resource from your config and run `terraform apply` in all workspaces, that resource will be removed everywhere.

### 🔄 Remote Backends and Workspaces

When using remote backends like **S3**, Terraform handles workspace state by creating a separate state file for each workspace (as long as the `key` includes `${terraform.workspace}`).

```hcl
key = "envs/${terraform.workspace}/terraform.tfstate"
```

This ensures isolated environments like:

- `envs/dev/terraform.tfstate`
- `envs/prod/terraform.tfstate`

### 🔐 Workspace Limitations with Secrets

If your environments differ in sensitive settings (e.g., secrets, passwords, tokens), do **not** rely on workspaces alone.

Instead, use:
- `terraform.tfvars` files
- Environment-specific variable overrides
- External secret managers (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager)

### 🧪 Common Exam & Real-World Traps

- **Manual State Editing**: Never manually change `terraform.tfstate` unless absolutely necessary—use `terraform state` commands instead.
- **Deleting Workspaces**: Running `terraform workspace delete` removes the workspace and its state file **but does not destroy resources**.
- **Drift Detection**: Terraform compares configuration against the state, not the live cloud infra—so drift is only detected when the plan is run.
- **State Locking Failures**: Without DynamoDB state locking in S3 backends, concurrent applies can corrupt state.
