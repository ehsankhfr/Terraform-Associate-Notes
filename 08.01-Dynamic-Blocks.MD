## 📚 **Terraform Dynamic Blocks**

### **Purpose**:
Dynamic blocks allow you to construct **repeatable, nested configuration blocks** inside Terraform resources or other configuration blocks. This helps you handle scenarios where a block may need to be repeated for each element of a collection (such as a list or map) while keeping the code clean and maintainable.

---

### **Supported Block Types**:
Dynamic blocks are supported within several key Terraform block types, including:

- **resource**
- **data**
- **provider**
- **provisioner**

This means you can use dynamic blocks to manage configurations for resources, data sources, providers, and even provisioners in a reusable and modular way.

---

### **Usage**:
Dynamic blocks allow you to generate multiple nested configuration blocks dynamically based on a variable, list, or map. This reduces redundancy and keeps the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). The idea is that for each element in the input collection, a corresponding block is generated inside the resource or data block.

---

### **Syntax**:
A dynamic block is defined with the `dynamic` keyword, and it requires a `for_each` expression to define which collection will be iterated over. The nested block that is to be repeated is defined using the `content` keyword.

#### General Syntax:
```hcl
dynamic "BLOCK_TYPE" {
  for_each = <collection>
  content {
    # nested block content
  }
}
```

- **`BLOCK_TYPE`**: The block type you are repeating (e.g., `ingress`, `tags`, `lifecycle`).
- **`for_each`**: A collection (like a list or map) that Terraform will iterate over to generate multiple nested blocks.
- **`content`**: The inner block that will be repeated for each element in the collection.

---

### **Example 1: Dynamic Blocks with `resource` Blocks**

Let’s say you have a **security group** resource, and you want to create multiple `ingress` rules dynamically based on a list of ports.

#### Example:

```hcl
variable "ingress_ports" {
  type    = list(number)
  default = [80, 443, 22]
}

resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name        = "example-sg"
  description = "Example security group"

  dynamic "ingress" {
    for_each = var.ingress_ports
    content {
      from_port   = each.value
      to_port     = each.value
      protocol    = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example:
- The `dynamic` block repeats the `ingress` block for each port in the list `ingress_ports`.
- `each.value` refers to the current value from the list being iterated (e.g., 80, 443, 22).

This results in three ingress rules being created for ports 80, 443, and 22.

---

### **Example 2: Dynamic Blocks with `provider` Blocks**

Let’s say you want to define multiple providers dynamically based on different configurations:

#### Example:

```hcl
variable "providers_config" {
  type = list(object({
    name   = string
    region = string
  }))
  default = [
    { name = "aws", region = "us-east-1" },
    { name = "aws", region = "us-west-2" }
  ]
}

provider "aws" {
  for_each = { for idx, config in var.providers_config : config.name => config }

  region = each.value.region
}
```

> ℹ️ **Note:** Provider blocks don't support `dynamic` blocks directly — instead, we use `for_each` at the top level to create multiple instances of a provider.

---

### **Example 3: Tags — Use Maps Instead of Dynamic Blocks**

Terraform AWS providers expect `tags` as a **map**, so using `dynamic` for `tags` usually isn’t necessary — and actually won’t work in most AWS resources.

#### ❌ **Incorrect or Unnecessary Use:**
```hcl
dynamic "tags" {
  for_each = var.tags_map
  content {
    key   = each.key
    value = each.value
  }
}
```
This **won’t work** because `tags` expects a map, not a nested block.

#### ✅ **Correct Use:**
```hcl
variable "tags_map" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    Name        = "Example Instance"
    Environment = "Development"
    Project     = "Terraform"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags          = var.tags_map
}
```
Use `tags = var.tags_map` directly.

### 💡 When to Use Dynamic Blocks

| Use Case                              | Use Dynamic Block? | Notes                                           |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Repeating `ingress` rules            | ✅ Yes           | Ideal scenario for `dynamic`                   |
| Repeating `ebs_block_device`         | ✅ Yes           | Clean and modular                              |
| Setting `tags` in AWS                | ❌ No            | Use plain `map`                                |
| Creating multiple `provider` blocks  | ❌ No            | Use `for_each` at the provider block level     |
| Static, one-off nested configuration | ❌ No            | Simpler and more readable to write directly    |

### ✅ TL;DR Final Thoughts

- ✅ Use `dynamic` when a **block is repeatable** and driven by a list or map.
- ❌ Don’t use `dynamic` for things like `tags` where a **map** is expected.
- 🪜 Avoid overuse. Use it only when it improves flexibility and cleanliness.
- 🧹 Prioritize readability — it’s okay to duplicate lines if it avoids complex logic.
