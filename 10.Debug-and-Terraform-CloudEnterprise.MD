## Debugging Terraform

### TF_LOG
- **Definition**: `TF_LOG` is an environment variable that enables verbose logging to help diagnose issues in Terraform workflows.
- **Usage**: Export the variable in your shell session to activate logging.
- **Log Output**: By default, logs are sent to standard error (stderr).

### Log Levels
- **TRACE**: The most detailed information, useful for deep debugging.
- **DEBUG**: General debug information, helpful for developers.
- **INFO**: Standard operational messages.
- **WARN**: Alerts about potential issues that are not necessarily errors.
- **ERROR**: Critical problems that stop Terraform operations.

### Persisting Logs
- Use the `TF_LOG_PATH` variable to save logs to a file instead of the terminal.
- **Example Setup on Linux**:
  ```bash
  export TF_LOG=TRACE
  export TF_LOG_PATH=./terraform.log
  ```

## Terraform Cloud and Enterprise Offerings

### HashiCorp Sentinel
- **Definition**: A Policy-as-Code tool built into Terraform Cloud and Enterprise to enforce security and compliance.
- **Language**: Uses Sentinel policy language designed to be readable by both technical and non-technical users.

#### Benefits
- **Sandboxing**: Executes policies in a safe, restricted environment.
- **Codification**: Converts organizational policies into version-controlled code.
- **Version Control**: Policies can be managed using Git.
- **Testing & Automation**: Automate policy testing and application.

#### Common Use Cases
- Enforce CIS benchmarks across all accounts.
- Prevent usage of expensive instance types (e.g., only allow `t3.micro`).
- Ensure no security group allows ingress on port 22 (SSH).

### HashiCorp Vault
- **Definition**: A tool for managing secrets, credentials, and protecting sensitive data.
- **Security**:
  - Encrypts data in transit and at rest.
  - Uses ACLs for granular access control.

#### Benefits
- Eliminates the need to hardcode secrets.
- Injects secrets at deployment runtime.
- Offers automatic credential rotation and fine-grained controls.

### Terraform Registry
- **Definition**: A public or private repository for Terraform modules and providers.

#### Features
- Share and reuse modules.
- Collaborate with others on module and provider development.
- Reference modules directly in Terraform configurations.

### Terraform Cloud Workspaces
- **Definition**: Named environments in Terraform Cloud with isolated state management.

#### Features
- Stores historical versions of the state.
- Keeps a record of every `plan` and `apply` operation.
- All Terraform runs occur on managed cloud VMs.

### Terraform OSS Workspaces
- **Definition**: Local environments that use different state files in the same working directory.

#### Features
- Each workspace is a directory under `.terraform`.
- Does not support cloud features like remote runs or logging.

### Benefits of Terraform Cloud
- **Collaboration**: Enables teams to work on infrastructure simultaneously.
- **Remote Execution**: Terraform runs on managed infrastructure.
- **Version Control Integration**: Supports GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
- **State Management**: Built-in remote state storage and locking.
- **Private Registry**: Share internal modules securely.
- **Cost Estimation & Policy Enforcement**: Tools like Sentinel and cost estimation provide governance.

## Comparison of State Storage Methods

| Feature                   | HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) | Local State                              | External State                           |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Storage Location         | Managed by HashiCorp           | On the user's local machine              | AWS S3, Azure Blob, GCS, etc.            |
| Access Control           | Built-in RBAC                  | Local file system permissions            | IAM roles, access keys, etc.             |
| Collaboration            | Built-in sharing               | Not suitable for collaboration           | Supports shared access via IAM policies  |
| State Locking            | Automatic                      | None                                     | Via external service (e.g., DynamoDB)    |
| Security                 | Encrypted & backed-up          | Manual encryption                        | Service-dependent (e.g., S3 encryption)  |
| Backup & Recovery        | Built-in versioning            | Manual backup                            | Depends on service (e.g., S3 versioning) |
| Scalability              | Fully scalable cloud service   | Limited by local resources               | Scales with storage backend              |
| Ease of Setup            | Simple Terraform Cloud setup   | Easiest (no config needed)               | Requires backend setup                   |
| Cost                     | Subscription-based             | Free (except for local resources)        | Depends on provider pricing              |
| Compliance & Governance  | Built-in with Sentinel         | None                                     | Custom or provider-managed               |
