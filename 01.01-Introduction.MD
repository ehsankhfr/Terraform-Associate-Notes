## 🧱 1. What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Before diving into Terraform, it's essential to understand the broader concept it belongs to: **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC). This practice transforms the way infrastructure is managed, shifting from manual provisioning to automated, version-controlled code.

---

### 🔹 Definition

**Infrastructure as Code** is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure (servers, networks, databases, etc.) through **machine-readable configuration files** rather than manual processes or GUIs.

---

### 🔹 Key Benefits

✅ **Repeatability & Consistency**  
- Avoids "snowflake" environments by codifying every infrastructure component.  
- Every deployment is predictable and repeatable.

✅ **Version Control & Auditability**  
- Code can be stored in Git (or other VCS), reviewed, tracked, and reverted.  
- Teams collaborate on infrastructure like they do on application code.

✅ **Automated Deployment**  
- IaC enables automation pipelines to provision, update, or tear down infrastructure **without human intervention**.

✅ **Speed & Efficiency**  
- Reduces time spent navigating GUIs or manually typing CLI commands.

✅ **Reduced Risk**  
- Minimizes misconfigurations and human error.

✅ **Cost Optimization**  
- Automatically destroy unused resources to avoid unnecessary cloud bills.

### 🔹 Declarative vs Imperative Approaches

| Declarative                            | Imperative                             |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| You **describe the desired state**    | You **specify step-by-step** how to achieve it |
| Terraform is **declarative**          | Shell scripts, Ansible (in some cases) are imperative |
| Example: “I want 3 EC2 instances”     | Example: “Run this script to create EC2 instances” |

📝 **Bonus Code Examples**:

- **Declarative (Terraform)**:
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_instance" "example" {
    count = 3
    ami           = "ami-abc123"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
  }
  ```

- **Imperative (Bash)**:
  ```bash
  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-abc123 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro
  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-abc123 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro
  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-abc123 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro
  ```

## 🧩 2. Terraform Workflow (Standard Lifecycle)

Terraform operates through a predictable and consistent 3-phase lifecycle. This structure simplifies infrastructure management and aligns with best practices.

---

### 🟪 1. **Write**

- Create Terraform configuration files (`.tf` or `.tf.json`) that define:
  - **Resources** (infrastructure components)
  - **Data sources**
  - **Variables & outputs**
  - **Modules**

✅ **Best Practice**: Store the code in a **GitHub repo** for versioning, collaboration, and CI/CD workflows.

---

### 🟪 2. **Plan**

Use `terraform plan` to:
- Preview what Terraform **intends to do**.
- Safely review **additions, changes, and deletions**.
- Validate changes **before** any action is taken.

---

### 🟪 3. **Apply**

Use `terraform apply` to:
- Execute the plan and **provision resources**.
- Record changes in the **state file**, which tracks actual infrastructure.
- Compare configuration vs current state to determine actions.

---

### 🔁 Bonus: Review/Refactor Loop

- Refactor your code as infrastructure evolves.
- Extract shared code into **modules**.
- Organize configurations using **input/output variables**, folders, and version control.

---

## 🔧 3. Core Terraform Commands – Certification Focus

Familiarity with these commands is **critical for the exam** and daily use.

---

### ⚙️ `terraform init`

- Initializes the Terraform working directory.
- Downloads required **providers** (e.g., AWS, Azure).
- Installs **modules** and sets up **backends** (local or remote).
- Generates `.terraform.lock.hcl` to lock provider versions.

📌 Must run this **first** when:
- Starting a new project
- Cloning a Terraform repo
- Changing provider requirements
- Switching or modifying backends

---

### 🧐 `terraform plan`

- Generates and displays an **execution plan**.
- Shows exactly what Terraform **would do**, without performing any action.
- Essential for **code review** and **safe infrastructure changes**.

---

### 🚀 `terraform apply`

- Applies the infrastructure changes.
- Prompts for confirmation unless `-auto-approve` is used.
- Updates the **state file** upon completion.

📁 **Terraform State File**:
- Stored as `terraform.tfstate` (by default).
- May be stored remotely (e.g., S3, Terraform Cloud).
- Represents the single source of truth for infrastructure.

---

### 💣 `terraform destroy`

- Destroys all resources defined in the configuration.
- Uses the state file to determine what to destroy.

⚠️ **Irreversible**. Always backup your state and double-check before running.

---

### 🧼 `terraform fmt`

- Formats your `.tf` files using Terraform’s standard style guide.
- Helps maintain consistency across teams.

---

### ✅ `terraform validate`

- Checks the configuration for **syntax errors** and **logical issues**.
- Does not connect to any cloud provider or evaluate state.

---

### 🧠 `terraform show`, `terraform output`

- `terraform show`: Displays current state details.
- `terraform output`: Displays outputs defined in your configuration.

---

### 🧩 Optional but Helpful: `terraform graph`

- Generates a visual dependency graph in DOT format.
- Helps you **understand resource relationships** and execution order.

---

## 📦 4. Installing Terraform – For Hands-On Practice

To follow along and try examples, install Terraform on your machine.

---

### 🔹 Method 1: Manual Installation

1. Visit [terraform.io/downloads](https://terraform.io/downloads)  
2. Download the binary for your OS  
3. Unzip it  
4. Move it to a directory in your system’s `$PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`)

---

### 🔹 Method 2: Use a Package Manager

#### 🐧 Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install terraform
```

#### 🟤 RHEL/Amazon Linux:

sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install terraform
```
